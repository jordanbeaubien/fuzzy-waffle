final system, you will be asked to present your work in 2 milestones.

*Milestone 1: (week of June 7th): Demo for Application screens*
(all needed User interfaces) and one screen connected to the database.

1.   Car Screen. Connected to the database. In this screen, users should be    able to add/modify/delete and search cars.

2.   Rental transaction screen. In this screen, users should be able to rent/book a car on specific dates from a specific branch. Only available cars should be rented. (Milestone 1, only the user interface)

3.   A screen that can execute five reports. These should be more complex reports. I am expecting to see nested queries and groups by usage. (Milestone 1, only the user interface)
